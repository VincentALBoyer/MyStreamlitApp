"""Custom drag-and-drop component for the bin-packing board.

Uses Streamlit's stable v1 custom-component protocol (declare_component with
a static frontend directory) rather than any bundler/React setup — the
frontend is a single self-contained frontend/index.html implementing the
well-established postMessage handshake (streamlit:componentReady /
streamlit:render / streamlit:setComponentValue / streamlit:setFrameHeight).

Items are dragged from a palette on the left — at real-to-scale size while
dragging — and dropped onto a fixed (no pan/zoom) grid bin on the right.
Placement validity is still enforced server-side in game_logic.can_place;
the client-side overlap check in the frontend is only for live drag-preview
feedback.
