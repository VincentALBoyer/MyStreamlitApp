"""Greedy Heuristics Intro Game — 2D Bin Packing.

Three modes sharing one instance format:

- Game: the in-browser drag-and-drop minigame (5 rounds, live scoring).
- Challenge: generate offline instances (seed + difficulty + count) to
  download as Excel and solve with your own code.
- Scoring: upload your completed instances file (bin/item data plus the
  x/y/rotated columns you filled in offline), get graded (0 profit for any
  infeasible instance), and inspect one submitted layout at a time.

The pedagogical hook: 2D bin packing is NP-hard, so there's no way to
compute the true optimum by hand or reasonably in a class session — so
students fall back on an intuitive rule of thumb (biggest first, best
value-per-area first, etc.). That rule of thumb *is* a greedy heuristic,
which is what the graded write-up asks them to name and describe.

### The challenge

You have **one fixed bin**. Items arrive for each round — drag them from
the list on the left and drop them into the bin. You can drag a placed
item again later to reposition it, or drag it back onto the list to
remove it. There are **5 rounds**, and each one is harder than the last.

Overlaps and out-of-bounds placements are allowed while you're playing —
but if your layout still has any when the round ends, that round scores
**0 profit**, no matter what you packed.

Each item has a **profit** (its color — pale to deep red — tells you how
valuable it is; hover an item to see the exact numbers) and a size. There's
no way to work out the perfect layout by hand here (packing rectangles
into a bin for maximum value is a genuinely hard problem) — so just go
with your gut. Whatever rule of thumb you end up using without thinking
about it too hard — biggest first? most valuable first? — is worth
remembering. You'll be asked to describe it afterwards.

**Scoring:** your score is the total profit of everything you packed,
across all 5 rounds. Your total time is tracked too.
